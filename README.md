# Pulse Sensor with OLED and Arduino
 In this project, we will learn how to design ECG Display using Pulse Sensor with OLED & Arduino. We will use 0.96â€³ OLED Display with 128x64 resolution for BPM & ECG waveform display. The I2C OLED uses only 2 wire, i.e SDA & SCK for serial communication.

The Arduino Sketch running over the device implements the various functionalities of the project. These functions are reading sensor data, converting them into strings, passing them to I2C communication, and displaying measured pulse rate in I2C OLED Display.

### Components Introduction:-

#### Arduino:-

Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple I/O board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing and MaxMSP). The boards can be assembled by hand or purchased preassembled; the open-source IDE can be downloaded for free at https://arduino.cc
